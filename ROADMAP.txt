- use `edn` as the master config
- transpile to other files, for example, `toml` & `yaml`
- render keyboard for desired hotkey combination, for example: `ctl-cmd` => `babel render`
- search for keyboard shortcut for given action on app, for example: open file in helix => `babel query`
- search for keyboard shortcut output, for example: where is `Tf` => `babel query`
- sort & list keymaps so it is easier to understand empty => `babel table`
- set up an automatic searcher based on root directory, for example: parse all `edn` files contained => `babel table`
- use flags to filter per app, action, etc
- implement TUI for `babel query`
